# Docker for Data Engineers

In order to run the code in this post you'll need to install the following:
 
1. [git version >= 2.37.1](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
2. [Docker version >= 20.10.17](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker compose v2 version >= v2.10.2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/#compose-v2-and-the-new-docker-compose-command).

**Windows users**: please setup WSL and a local Ubuntu Virtual machine following **[the instructions here](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-10#1-overview)**. Install the above prerequisites on your ubuntu terminal; if you have trouble installing docker, follow **[the steps here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-22-04#step-1-installing-docker)** (only Step 1 is necessary). Please install the **make** command with `sudo apt install make -y` (if its not already present). 

All the commands shown below are to be run via the terminal (use the Ubuntu terminal for WSL users).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/josephmachado/docker_for_data_engineers.git
cd efficient_data_processing_spark
```
